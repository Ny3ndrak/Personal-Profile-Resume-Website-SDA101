In my HTML personal profile project, I applied several key concepts:

HTML Structure: I used semantic HTML tags such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> to create a well-structured and accessible webpage.

CSS Styling: I implemented external CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the profile. I utilized concepts like Flexbox and Grid to achieve a responsive design.

Media Integration: I embedded images and videos to make the profile more engaging.

Navigation: I created a simple navigation using button with links to different sections of the profile.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
Responsive Design: I learned how to create a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes using media queries.

CSS Flexbox and Grid: I enhanced my understanding of layout techniques, enabling me to position elements precisely.

Form Validation: I gained knowledge about HTML5 form validation attributes to ensure proper user input.

Accessibility: I learned about the importance of accessibility features like alt attributes for images and ARIA roles.

Reflection 
What I Learned
Through this project, I learned the importance of a well-structured HTML document and how CSS can be used to create visually appealing and responsive designs. I also gained a deeper understanding of integrating multimedia elements and ensuring accessibility for all users.

Challenges Faced
Responsive Design Challenges: Ensuring the layout looked good on all devices was challenging. I overcame this by using media queries and testing on multiple devices.

Form Validation Issues: Initially, the contact form did not validate user input correctly. I resolved this by researching HTML5 form validation attributes and implementing them.
